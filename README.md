# Ventura TRAVEL

## Scripts

Run `npm start` in the root folder to simultaneously start the backend and frontend.

## Task

Create an API endpoint with Express.js to send this data (convert it to an object):

name: Trip 1 | price: 1000 | currency: EUR name: Trip 2 | price: 1000 | currency: USD name: Trip 3 | price: 3000 | currency: EUR

Consume this API in a react application where you show the info in a row of cards. The card should be a title with the name, and the price at the bottom of the card. Also add a box-shadow of your
liking to the card.
